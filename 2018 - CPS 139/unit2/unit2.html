        <h4 class="description">One Paragraph About Myself</h4>
        <p>Hello, I'm Henry. Currently, I'm 29 and live in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin. The first dog that I've
            ever owned just recently turned a year old, and I wouldn't trade him for anything. After years
            of thinking that college wouldn't be right for me, I finally decided to give it a go - and now,
            here I am.</p>

        <h4 class="description">My 3 Favorite Topics</h4>
        <p><span>After ~17 years of experience, it's safe to say that I love computer programming languages.</span>
            <span>I enjoy creating digital art, both as a form of "drawing/painting" and for website design.</span>
            <span>I've considered myself to be an avid gamer, but I'm really only addicted to the "Destiny" franchise, now.</span></p>
        <hr>
        <h4 class="description">More About My Topics</h4>
        <p><span style="font-weight:bold; display: inline-block;">Programming.</span> When I was thirteen, a friend rented an HTML
            book from the library and showed me it one day. After borrowing it from him, I was hooked. I started a couple different
            fan-sites for video games, one of which lasted about nine years, on-and-off. This also sparked me into looking
            at other computer languages to dabble in - several of which have helped me find freelance work (such as my
            current job). To date, I've used HTML4/XHTML/HTML5, CSS/CSS3, PHP, JavaScript, Java, ActionScript, SQL, and lately, C++.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight:bold; display: inline-block;">Digital Art.</span> Websites (especially certain "fan-sites")
            used to have a lot more graphical identity than they do today. The standard Web 2.0 appearance of everything gives
            most sites a similar look and feel, nowadays. However, I still find enjoyment in trying to provide a special
            identity in the graphical look of websites. I also recently got a digital drawing tablet for my computer so I've
            been having fun messing around with digital
            painting.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight:bold; display: inline-block;">Video Games.</span> Although I didn't get my first game system
            until I was in sixth grade (a GameBoy Color), I loved going over to friends' houses to play video games with them.
            Once I saw a friend playing Zelda: The Ocarina of Time on their Nintendo 64, I was blown away at how video games
            could be experienced. There's a long list of history I could write past that point, but as I've grown up, I've played
            games less and less (yet still try new ones out from time-to-time). For quite a while now, I've mostly played Destiny
            (1 &amp; 2) and have made some really close friends. It's amazing how technology has evolved and created new situations
            that couldn't have been possible in the past.</p>

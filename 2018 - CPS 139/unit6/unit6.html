                <h2>Nintendo Consoles</h2>
                <p>Below is a list of consoles that hardware &amp; software manufacturer,
                    Nintendo, has made. Although they've had a much longer history of <em>not</em>
                    making games and system, their revival of gaming (ending the video game crash
                    of 1983) has continued to evolve the focus of their company. Note that not every
                    console has appeared in both the U.S. and Japan. Release dates are based on the
                    American release if it released there, otherwise the Japanese release if it was
                    exclusive to Japan.</p>

                <h2>The Origins of Nintendo</h2>
                <p class="note">Note that the following is a direct copy of the Wikipedia.org article, "History of Nintendo".</p>
                <p>Nintendo started out as a small Japanese company, founded by Fusajiro Yamauchi on September 23, 1889, as
                    Nintendo Koppai.Based in Kyoto, Japan, the business produced and marketed Hanafuda cards. The name
                    "Nintendo" is commonly assumed to mean "leave luck to heaven", but there are no historical records to
                    validate this assumption. The cards, which were all handmade, soon began to gain in popularity, and Yamauchi
                    had to hire assistants to mass-produce cards to keep up with the demand.</p>
                <p>Fusajiro Yamauchi did not have a son to take over the family business. Following common Japanese tradition, he
                    adopted his son-in-law, Sekiryo Yamauchi, (after the wife). In 1929, Yamauchi retired from the company and
                    allowed Sekiryo Yamauchi to take over the company as president. In 1933, Sekiryo Yamauchi established a joint
                    venture with another company and renamed the company Yamauchi Nintendo &amp; Co.</p>
                <p>In 1947, Sekiryo established a distribution company, Marufuku Co., Ltd., to distribute the Hanafuda cards, as
                    well as several other brands of cards that had been introduced by Nintendo. Sekiryo Yamauchi also had only
                    daughters, so again his son-in-law (Shikanojo Inaba, renamed Shikanojo Yamauchi) was adopted into the family.
                    Shikanojo never became president because he abandoned his family. Subsequently, his son Hiroshi was brought
                    up by his grandparents. He later took over the company instead of his father.</p>

                <h3>Computer Programming</h3>
                <p>When I was thirteen, a friend rented an HTML book from the library and showed me it one day. After borrowing it
                    from him, I was hooked. I started a couple different fan-sites for video games, one of which lasted about nine
                    years, on-and-off. This also sparked me into looking at other computer languages to dabble in - several of which
                    have helped me find freelance work (such as my current job). To date, I've used:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Client Side languages
                            <ul>
                                <li>Website-related
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>HTML4/XHTML/HTML5</li>
                                        <li>CSS/CSS3</li>
                                        <li>JavaScript</li>
                                        <li>ActionScript</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Desktop environment
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Java</li>
                                        <li>C++</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Server Side languages
                            <ul>
                                <li>PHP</li>
                                <li>SQL</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                <h3>Digital Art</h3>
                <p>Websites (especially certain "fan-sites") used to have a lot more graphical identity than they do today. The
                    standard Web 2.0 appearance of everything gives most sites a similar look and feel, nowadays. However, I still find
                    enjoyment in trying to provide a special identity in the graphical look of websites. I also recently got a digital
                    drawing tablet for my computer so I've been having fun messing around with digital painting.</p>
                <p>I prefer digital art compared to traditional art for the following reasons:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>No mess</li>
                        <li>Accidents happen; digital canvases have arrays of <em>undo</em>s</li>
                        <li>A quicker and easier access to blending &amp; gradient options</li>
                        <li>Artwork can be saved with layers for easier editing</li>
                        <li>Unlimited backups can be saved; no physical, excessive buildup</li>
                    </ol>

                <h3>Video Games</h3>
                <p style="text-align: right;">Although I didn't get my first game system until I was in sixth grade (a GameBoy Color),
                    I loved going over to friends' houses to play video games with them. Once I saw a friend playing Zelda: The Ocarina of
                    Time on their Nintendo 64, I was blown away at how video games could be experienced. There's a long list of history I
                    could write past that point, but as I've grown up, I've played games less and less (yet still try new ones out from
                    time-to-time). For quite a while now, I've mostly played Destiny (1 &amp; 2) and have made some really close friends.
                    It's amazing how technology has evolved and created new situations that couldn't have been possible in the past.</p>

                        <p>I had gotten that tablet as a gift last Christmas and decided to test it out. While I've
                            had a lot of experience with digital art in the past (mostly photo manipulation and website
                            design stuff), this was the first time I was able to use a digital tablet as a drawing board.
                            After roughly a half hour or so, I managed to doodle a decent picture of an apple, as you can
                            see to the right.

                        </div>
                        <p>When I was about 13 (around 2001), I started learning HTML. To keep me interested, I decided to make
                            a fan-site for a video game series, as they were relatively popular at the time. Seeing
                            as I was addicted to the Legend of Zelda games, I chose that and got my foot in the door
                            within the "Zelda community". After years of keeping the site afloat (...mostly), I
                            became better and better at HTML, CSS, and Photoshop, and later got into other languages
                            as well. To the left is a screenshot of the last layout I made for the site prior to
                            me shutting it down. Although the image shows that it was taken in 2009, I think I actually
                            made it in 2008, as that screenshot was just a dummy-page I made for a quick reference
                            for the future (well, <em>present</em> now).
                        </p>
                        <p>Even though I made it about 10 years ago, and I didn't "draw" the individual artwork inside
                            of the picture (it uses some "official art"), it's still one of my favorite project results.
                            <em>That</em> tiled background was a pain to properly make...
                        </p>
                        <p>Most websites now focus on Web 2.0 standards, which has had an impact on "creative" looking
                            websites. Nowadays, it seems that most pages look like a version of a Wordpress theme.

                <h2 class="question" id="client_and_server_side">Do browsers render everything?</h2>
                <p class="answer">Although HTML, CSS, Flash, JavaScript, and more are rendered by your internet browser
                    (client-side languages), not everything you see online is. Some systems run on the server (aptly
                    called server-side languages). There are many differences and reasons for the two to exist, but both
                    are required for bringing you the content that you see on a computer, phone, or what-have-you.</p>

                <h2 class="question" id="explain_with_example">Why?</h2>
                <p class="answer">
                    While your internet browser interprets markup data and other types of scripts, it has to retrieve
                    the information from somewhere. That source is on someone else's computer and requires an Operating
                    System, just like yours, to run and process information. Certain examples of server-side scripts,
                    restrict access or perform certain rulesets, such as with <em>.htaccess</em> pages (which can define
                    rules for things such as hotlinking, URL redirection, and rewriting URLs for improved SEO practices).</p>

            <section>
                <h2 class="question" id="downfalls">Why not have everything server-side?</h2>
                <p class="answer">The cost of code running on the server means that anytime an action is triggered, it must
                    send and receive the proper information. Have you heard of
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack">Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS)</a>
                    attacks? Those happen when too many requests are consistently sent in an absurd amount of time. Not only does this
                    impact the server's performance, but it can potentially cost a lot of money if information isn't cached;
                    bandwidth isn't free. While certain pairings of languages <sup>(ex. PHP &amp; SQL)</sup> can do things
                    such as sign you into a website based off of a database that the website has hiding on its server,
                    every request uses up resources and information to grant you that access.</p>
